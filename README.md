# Photovoltaic-Performance-by-Tech-and-Latitude

This Jupyter notebook project was used to compare the theoretical performance of a fixed-tilt versus single-axis tracking photovoltaic system.

Our solar experts reported that industry modeling (based on empirical PVOut measurements) pinned the 'breakeven' latitude around the 42nd parallel

The goal of the project was to verify this latitude and ultimately inform decisions about predicted performance relative to pricing by state market.

Because this was theoretical, no actual insolation or PVOut data were used.

Formulas are based on basic geometric relationship between panels and the sun angle, identifying theoretical maxima and function profiles for comparison.

The effect of scattered / diffuse radiation were also considered.
